```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## The Problem

Suppose you want to print a multiline pattern to the console, such as:

```
*
**
```

How can we get this?

## First Solution

You could use the `cat()` function like this:

```{r}
cat("*\n**")
```

## Second Solution

You can also separate the call to `cat()` over lines:

```{r}
cat("
*
**")
```


But note that this produces an extra newline at the beginning!
