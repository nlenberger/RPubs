## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be *generated* that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

>This is a cool blockquote.

My TODO list for today:

* get up
* get coffe
* go to boring job
* meet with boring manager Rob

Maybe better as ordered:

1. get up
1. get coffe
1. go to boring job
    * it's far away
    * take the bus
1. meet with boring manager Rob

You can do math, inline like this:  $A = \pi r^2$.  You can also display it:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$

Cool!
